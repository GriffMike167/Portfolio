<ul>
    <ui>About Me (Home Page)</ui>
    <p>Working on this page are links dedicated to a portfolio and a contact page. Also a collapsable navBar set to change at different resolution types. The photos are inclosed in a hexagon that when hovering it gets inclosed showing the city and location that it was taken. A little information above gives some insight into what I have done so far in life. Going forward i would like to have this do the opposite, and have the photo already inclosed and have the picture appear when you hover the city and location. When the navBar collapses there is a button on the top left, when clicking this it leads to the links to the other pages, the same on all pages.</p>
    
   <ui>Portfolio</ui>
    <p>Portfolio page is set up to showcase things that have been accomplished. The set up can be done is several different was. I have used photos of some of the things i have done, instead of projects, so eventually they will be traded out. The idea is to have photos of different things that have been done, when hovering over it will give a brief description of the project, when clicking on the photo it will lead directly to a working project.</p>

   <ui>Contact</ui>
    <p>Contact page is simple and to the point using columns, rows, containers, and inputs to accomplish. Area for phone, email, website, name, and message all available here.</p>
</ul>

   <p>Built using VS Code, and deployed using Github. The idea is to have one place where someone can go to get information about myself that gives a little insight into how I think and execute ideas.
